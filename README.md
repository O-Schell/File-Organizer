The aim of the File Organizer Project is to create a programm in python that organize file by their extension in sub-directory.
There a few more things that I want to be clear about for this project:
## CODE
The code must be:
- it to easily readible by everyone - Unless there is no other way, prioritise readibility on performance.
- clear and organized - Use and abuse of prettifier.

## DESIGN
When adding design to it, it must be:
- minimalist - As less as we need; Simple, fast and smooth UI animation.
or
- gradient/fluid - Colors must mixe perfectly and only used for loading/waiting animation
