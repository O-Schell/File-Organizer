# File-Organizer

The aim of the File Organizer Project is to create a programm in python a programm that organize file by their extension in sub-directory.
There a few more things that a want to do for this project:
1. I want it to easily readible by everyone. The code must be clear clear and organized. No super-advenced code, bar if there is no other way to do it
2. I want to have a minimalistic design and some gradient design. If we can, play with some animation
